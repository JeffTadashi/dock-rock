Hello! 

This is my collection of quick docker images for running simple network/security tools, without needed to hassle with manual installation, getting Python/Perl/Go dependencies installed, building, etc.

Simply install docker on your machine, then you can run like the following example:
```
docker run --rm jefftadashi/nmap example.com
```
See all the folders in this repository for the docker images that are available. Also check out my docker hub directly at:
